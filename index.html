        <h2>Project Overview - Revealing Relationships Between Health, Economy, and Mobility</h2>
        <h4> This interactive data visualization project explores the complex relationships between COVID-19's health impacts, economic consequences, and mobility changes across countries. Using comprehensive global datasets, it reveals patterns in how different nations experienced and recovered from the pandemic through a combination of interactive maps, comparative charts, and a scatterplot matrix that uncovers correlations between key pandemic metrics.
